The linear regression line for delay vs packet loss probability p using selective repeat ARQ shows almost no slope. This implies that over the range of p given by the spec, p doesn't have a serious impact on delay. I expected a slightly positive linear regression line, which would imply that delay increases as packet loss increases. But, for low values of p like this, this result is not really that surprising.

This SR result is nearly the same as with Go-Back-N, which is expected and lends credence to both results. Keep in mind that I did 20 runs for each value of p (spec required 5), so I have some confidence that there is in fact very little correlation between p and delay (for this range of p). If we ranged p from .1 to .5, I expect we would see a strongly positive linear regression line, which would imply that delay increases as p increases.
