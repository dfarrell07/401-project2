The linear regression line for delay against MSS using Go-Back-N is quite strongly negative. This implies that increasing the MSS reduces average file transfer delay. This is expected, as packing more data into each packet, especially over the low MSS range stipulated, is almost always a good idea. More data can be transfered in fewer packets, so less packet loss will occur, resulting in fewer retransmissions and an overall lower delay.

The results of this test are a bit more clear than many of the other tests. The linear regression line is fairly strongly negative, which implies a fairly strong correlation between MSS and delay.
