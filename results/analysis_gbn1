The linear regression line of the timing results as the window size N is varied shows a slightly negative trend. This implies that increasing N reduces average delay. This is the result I expected, especially with a low p (as stipulated by the spec).

The results are quite varied, and again, N is only very slightly negative. So, the strength of the N to delay correlation is somewhat weak.
