Usage: Use freely

The best way to run this program is to use the included 'run' executable shell script.

Usage: `. run [num_runs]`

Each run cleans up old data, generates a new data file from random data and a word list,
generates random params for the client and server, launches the client and server, waits 
for them to complete and then checks the results. 

See the project spec for complete details.
